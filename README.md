## Reproducing Results

To reproduce the main results presented in the paper, you can use the `run_loocv.py` script. Ensure you have the necessary data in the `Data/` directory.

```bash
python run_loocv.py [options]
```

Options:
- `--stiffness-path`: Path to stiffness data directory (default: `Data/Stiffness_Reduction/`)
- `--strain-path`: Path to strain data directory (default: `Data/Strain/`)
- `--batch-size`: Batch size for training
- `--hidden-dim`: Hidden dimension for GNN models
- `--num-gnn-layers`: Number of GNN layers
- `--dropout`: Dropout probability
- `--epochs`: Maximum number of epochs
- `--patience`: Patience for early stopping
- `--output-dir`: Directory to save results (default: `results/`)

The script will perform Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation using the best performing model identified in the comparison phase and save the predictions and evaluation metrics to the specified output directory.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorBoardX
- scienceplots (optional)
- Optuna (for hyperparameter tuning, not required for reproducing main results)

Install core dependencies with:
```bash
pip install torch torch-geometric numpy pandas matplotlib tensorboardx
```
Install optional dependencies:
```bash
pip install scienceplots optuna
```

## Interpreting Results

The `results/` directory will contain `loocv_results.json` with key metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAPE, RÂ²) and `loocv_predictions.png` visualizing the true vs predicted stiffness reduction. Loss plots for each fold will also be saved.
